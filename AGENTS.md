## What this repo is

A bundled part: Caddy, as the stack lemonfiber ships carries it. The
[bundle contract](https://github.com/lemonfiber/spec/blob/main/20-architecture/contracts/bundle.md)
says how the catalogue pins it and how lemonfiber carries it.

## The rules you cannot break

- **The plugin id is the service's id** (`ARCH-R266`). The container, the
  configuration directory, the settings and the journal keep their names.
- **One service, speaking no contract**, while the bundle assembles it. It
  declares `replaces` naming its own id, which is how it takes the id, the port
  and the hostname the bundle reserves for it (`ARCH-R222`).
- **Its claims' recordings sit under `recordings/caddy/`**, and its starting
  files, where it has any, under `config/caddy/` (`ARCH-R271`).
- **Every service declares `reaches` and `asks_for`** (`ARCH-R270`).
- **No Python here.** The reader is spec's `first-party-plugin` workflow's.
- **The image is built here** (`OPS-R90`). The `Dockerfile` builds it from
  its upstream's, and it runs under the posture its manifest declares (`ARCH-R250`);
  `posture/prepare`, where there is one, gives it what lemonfiber writes at
  install. Its pin moves on the release app's rolling pull request.
